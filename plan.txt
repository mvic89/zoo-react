Page structure
    Header with logo (each page)
    Navigational menu with link to (each page):
        Home
        Birds
        Mammals
        Reptiles
    Footer (each page)
    Sidebar + main content area
        Content will be different for each page, but page layout stays the same

-----------------------------
Home Page
    Sidebar
        Shows list with the names of all the animals
    Main content
        Show a welcome message on page load
        When animal is clicked, welcome message is replaced with short summary of that animal
        'Read more' button is displayed after 'short summary', clicking it leads to 'animal details
        If the 'active' animals name is clicked again, it is no longer active and 'welcome' message is displayed
        Only one animal can be active at a time

        Short summary of animal consists of:
            Small image of animal
            Name of animal
            first 200 characters of the description
            what the animal eats
            which group it belongs to WITH a link to the group page (eg mammal, bird or reptile)
            Clicking on 'read more' button for any animal on the home page should show all the animal details

        Animal details:
            Pop up modal of sorts - should fill the entire screen except header
            Show full summary of the animal
            Show a close button to return to the previous view

-----------------
Group Page
    Sidebar
        Show list with animal names of ONLY that group (no birds in reptile page)
    Main content
        Show message about that group type
        When an animal name is clicked, show full summary of the animal
        The full summary should show all the properties of an animal. (how it's displayed is up to me!)
